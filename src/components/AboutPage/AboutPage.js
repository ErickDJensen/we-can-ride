      It is the mission of We Can Ride, Inc. to improve the lives of individuals with disabilities or special needs through equine assisted activities and therapy.
      <br />
      Itâ€™s not about what disabilities or challenges our riders face, but rather what their abilities are and how they can be discovered through therapeutic horseback riding and other equine assisted activities. 
      <br />
      Join us in helping make a difference!
